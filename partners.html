          <span class="atc-info"> ABOUT<br><br>CURRENT: Feminist Electronic Art Symposium is a multidisciplinary, intersectional, music and electronic art symposium working with women and non-binary artists in Vancouver and beyond.
          </span>
      <br><br>
      The inaugural event took place in July of 2017 as a 3-day, multi-venue, music and arts showcase featuring events, panels, youth mentorships, and workshops. We expanded our programming in our second year which took place in July 2018 as a 5-day, multi-venue event which included performances, workshops, keynotes, panels, gallery exhibition, film screenings and community focus groups for municipal arts & culture policy recommendations. 
      <br><br>
      This year’s CURRENT Symposium will take the form of a Mentorship Program, in which selected applicants will participate in 3 full day sessions and receive a stipend. In these sessions, we wish to impart the skills necessary for our participants to continue making culture, from the embodied point of view of underrepresented communities. By following a localized curriculum, the Mentorship Program will prepare its participants in the areas of grant writing, curatorial vision development, community building, project planning, budgeting, networking, and multi-day event programming. All participants will be offered future event planning opportunities where they can apply their skills through our partners at New Forms Festival, VIVO Media Arts Centre, and the Western Front in Vancouver. 
      <br><br>
      The purpose of this structured mentorship program is so local emerging and aspiring cultural producers have an opportunity to learn from CURRENT’s team and network on how to produce events and arts programming similar to CURRENT. We hope to nurture more BIPOC cultural producers in this city and contribute to BC’s electronic art and cultural production pedagogy.
