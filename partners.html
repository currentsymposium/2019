        <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">VIVO Media Arts Centre</span> was the first video exchange library, one of the earliest international video centres and remains one of Canada’s longest operating artist-run centres. VIVO’s founding mandate was to facilitate international information exchange through a public video library. By the 1980s that mandate expanded to provide access to video equipment, basic workshops, and to disseminate information about media arts to the public. This was achieved primarily through Video Guide, a magazine published by the centre and distributed internationally from 1978 – 1992.<br><br>
        Today, VIVO’s mandate is to directly support artists and independent community-based producers to develop, exchange, and disseminate their skills in a supportive environment through accessible services and programs. Our vision is a robust, diverse, and vibrant media arts sector: a catalyst for critical and innovative engagement with the material forms and cultural meanings of media and technology. VIVO’s programs offer a broad range of services and opportunities to artists and the public.</p>

The Western Front currently maintains programs in Exhibitions, Media Art and New Music, as well as an extensive archive of audio-visual materials.
