    <div class="content" style="width:100%"><!-- <div class="pagetitle">ARTISTS</div> --><div class="mission"><!-- <span class="subtitle">MISSION</span>  --><strong>CURRENT</strong> is a multidisciplinary, intersectional, music and electronic art symposium working with women and non-binary artists in Vancouver, BC and beyond. The goal of this symposium is to foster and disseminate feminist content through the cross-pollination of ideas, and intergenerational knowledge sharing. By offering free, public, all ages panels and accessible workshops, we wish to cultivate growth within the local community, and create a more equal landscape within the growing Electronic Arts ecology. </div></div>
    <div class="content2"><div class="aboutinfo row">The key focus of the project is to cultivate growth within the local community through building cross border relations, allowing young local artists to connect with music collectives and artists from outside of Canada with the intention of increasing global opportunities for local artists.<br><br> In order to achieve this, on top of our focus on artists within the Vancouver community including a strong presence from Vancouver based collectives Genero, Nuzi whose focus is on increasing visibility of WOC and gender non conforming individuals, Youth focused collective Elastic and local DJ education facilitators Intersessions.Although the focus of the project is on showcasing and creating opportunities for Vancouver artists we feel that it is important and enriching for those local artists to connect and learn from artists both from and outside of their local community. This is a concept that has proved successful as artists involved in our first year have since acted upon the connections forged at the symposium to secure international bookings and radio play.<br><br> To assist with our commitment to encourage youth involvement in the events,  part of our strategy focuses around working with outreach facilitators at SFU, Emily Carr, UBC and Nimbus to promote student participation within the events through both workshops and volunteer opportunities.

    <p class="bio" style="width:100%;padding:0"><img src="images/alex.jpg" alt="Alexandra"><span class="producers">ALEXANDRA CHEN</span> is driven to work towards moving Vancouver's electronic scene towards the forefront of sound while creating safer spaces where marginalized folks can lose themselves in music, where the dance floor is a space of freedom, self-expression, and where dividing lines are blurred. Whether booking international headliners or selecting local acts, she aims to amplify the voices of people underrepresented in the music industry. She is currently an active member of New Forms Media Society’s board. </p><br><br>
<p class="bio" style="width:100%;padding:0"><img src="images/ashlee.jpg" alt="Ash"><span class="producers">ASH LUK</span> is a musician, curator and graphic artist. They make up part of electronic duo Minimal Violence and punk trio Lié. Luk has been working as an event curator in the city for over five years both as a founder of queer techno initiative Bodyheat and as part of Sacred Sound Club collective. Luk is drawn towards electronic music because of its ability to bridge the intersections of culture. Electronic music is focused around community gathering and embodies the shift away from the ego and towards collective experience. It is because of this that they believe in music as a dominant force in restructuring the cultural narrative.</p><br><br>
