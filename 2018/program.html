<strong>Karla Cruz</strong> is a nightlife culture coordinator and member of Elastic Collective. Karla has always had a passion for activism gained through their lived experience as a queer, non-binary mixed Latinx femme. In 2015, dancing in the pit at a concert, Karla was captivated by the shared energy of the audience. Eager for more, they packed their bags and moved from Squamish to Vancouver.
A search for similar experiences led them to discover the underground, in which they connected with Elastic and Diversity: Arts Music & Entertainment (DAME). Started by youth for youth, Elastic is an art collective centring women, BIPOC, and queer folk residing in Metro Vancouver. Through these collaborations they have hosted several events, including a training program that pushes nightlife's marginalized groups into positions of power.

<br><br>
<strong>Good Night Out</strong> was founded out of an awareness of the links between alcohol consumption and sexual aggression and initiated from community concerns that staff and patrons in Vancouver’s nightlife could benefit from education around how to recognize, interrupt and prevent sexual harassment and assault on nights out. Good Night Out uses recent research on gendered violence, bystander intervention, and anti-oppressive techniques to create a variety of original educational tools, interventions and messaging aimed at reducing gendered and homophobic harassment and violence in our city’s arts, culture and entertainment scene. They are committed to engaging our community with these issues in ways that are authentic, meaningful and interactive. The work that Good Night Out has done in Vancouver has been presented on a local and international scale, with their team being looked to as experts in the field of violence against women.
<br><br>
<strong>Battered Women’s Support Services (BWSS)</strong> is a feminist voice against violence and oppression. BWSS is a strong, dynamic organization that provides support and advocacy for women who have experienced abuse, as well as community education and training about violence against women. Part of a global feminist anti-violence movement, our long-term goal is the elimination of all violence against women and girls.
